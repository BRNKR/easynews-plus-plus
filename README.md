## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Easynews?

Easynews is a premium Usenet provider offering a web-based Usenet browser. It enables users to search, preview, and download files from Usenet newsgroups without requiring a newsreader. Known for its user-friendly interface and fast download speeds, Easynews serves as an alternative to debrid services (Real-Debrid, Premiumize, AllDebrid, etc.). An active Easynews subscription is required to use this addon.

### Why can't I find specific content?

First, verify the content exists on [Easynews web search](https://members.easynews.com/). If unavailable or returning poor quality results (duration < 5 minutes, marked as spam, no video), the addon won't find it either.

If the content exists on Easynews but the addon can't find it, this might be due to:

- Title matching issues between Easynews API and media player metadata
- Unconventional title formats
- Special character handling

Examples of challenging cases:

- Anime series like `death note` using non-standard episode numbering
- Movies with partial metadata matches (e.g., `Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One`)
- Special character handling (e.g., `WALL¬∑E` vs `WALL-E`)

For these cases, consider self-hosting and adding custom titles or using the public instance and create a new issue with the custom titles you want to get supported.

### Why is there a 50-stream limit?

The addon limits results to the top 50 highest quality streams to:

- Prevent media player overload
- Optimize performance
- Ensure quality-focused results (prioritizing 4K/UHD ‚Üí 1080p ‚Üí 720p)
- Sort by file size within the same resolution
